ü§ñ Overview

Smart Cancer Care simplifies the complex process of personalized cancer treatment using advanced AI models. It works by assessing patient records, detecting screening gaps, and generating tailored treatment strategies. This tool aims to improve patient outcomes while maintaining data security and privacy.

üîã Core Functionalities

Custom Treatment Plans: Processes patient medical data to highlight gaps in cancer screenings and suggest specific follow-up actions.

Secure Data Management: Implements encryption to protect sensitive medical records and facilitates secure sharing between healthcare providers.

Interactive Dashboard: Offers a clear interface for patients to track their appointments, treatment progress, and milestones.

üèÜ Inspiration Behind the Project

This initiative stems from a personal experience of losing a loved one to cancer. The challenges in coordinating care and maintaining treatment plans often resulted in inefficiencies and missed opportunities for timely interventions. This project is a step toward ensuring no patient faces such struggles, leveraging technology to offer seamless and effective cancer care solutions.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

npm start

üöÄ Application Workflow

Upload Patient Data: Users can securely upload medical records and diagnostic reports.

AI-Generated Insights: The assistant analyzes uploaded files to identify gaps and provide actionable insights.

Personalized Monitoring: Patients can use the dashboard to track their health progress and upcoming appointments.

üí° AI Framework Integration

The system integrates a robust AI framework to enhance functionality:

Image Processing: Analyzes medical images for better diagnostics.

NLP Models: Processes patient records for accurate interpretation and treatment suggestions.

Real-Time Processing: Ensures fast and efficient analysis for timely care.

Example Integration Code:

const analyzePatientData = async (file, apiKey) => {
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  reader.onload = async () => {
    const base64Data = reader.result.split(",")[1];
    const result = await fetch("https://api.example.com/analyze", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ data: base64Data }),
    });

    const analysis = await result.json();
    console.log("Analysis Result:", analysis);
  };
};
